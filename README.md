Bio: Welcome, my name is Professor Piro, I have officially been brought on as a full-time Computer Science Professor with Florida Southwestern within the Department of Business & Technology. Please excuse me in advance, as I am very excited and passionate to be here. Needless, prior to joining the community, I received my Master's of Computer Science from Colorado Technical University, Bachelor's of Arts and Sciences in Philosophy, and Bachelor's of Science in Software Engineering from Florida Gulf Coast University. Aside from my studies, I first began working as a developer Intern with Lee County Department of Transportation, then Hertz Corp in Estero. From there I moved on to Night Owl Security Products in Naples, maker of Smart Home Products, performing work as a Quality Assurance Analyst, and Technician. Later, I started working for a marketing company doing Website Development, Social Media, and Technician work, which led me to begin Adjuncting at FSW last Spring. When I'm not teaching, you'll find me working on my Doctoral Studies for my Ph.D. in Cybersecurity, or helping some clients do development work.
